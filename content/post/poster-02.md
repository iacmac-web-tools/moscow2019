## Background: 

According to the WHO position paper published in September 2018, the preferred strategy for use of the tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) in endemic settings is to screen for prior dengue infection (PDI) before vaccination. Detection of anti-dengue IgG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is generally used to determine PDI status, however ELISAs are less specific than neutralization assays because of flavivirus cross-reactivity. We determined the suitability of four rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and two conventional ELISAs to identify PDI and assessed flavivirus cross-reactivity.

## Materials/methods: 

The evaluation panel comprised baseline serum samples collected in CYD-TDV clinical trials and from Sanofi employees. Specificity was assessed using 534 dengue PRNT50 negative samples from continental USA and endemic regions. Negativity of endemic region samples was further confirmed by dengue NS1 IgG ELISA. Sensitivity was assessed using 270 samples from recent (within 13 months, n=90) or remote (3 to 4 years, n=90) prior virologically-confirmed dengue cases, and dengue PRNT50 positive samples from endemic regions (n=90). Cross-reactivity was assessed in 194 dengue seronegative samples that were seropositive for one of the following viruses: yellow fever (n=57), Japanese encephalitis (n=37), West-Nile (n=59) or Zika (n=41). RDTs were from Alere/SD Bioline, Bio-Rad, CTK and GenBody. Indirect dengue IgG ELISAs were from Alere/Panbio and Focus Diagnostics.

## Results: 

All evaluated RDTs and the Panbio Indirect IgG ELISA had favorable specificity (>98%). RDT sensitivity for identifying PDI was moderate (40%â€“70%) and lower than with the ELISAs (?90%). Cross-reactivity to Japanese encephalitis was not observed with any RDT. Cross-reactivity to other flaviviruses was uncommon. Only the CTK RDT showed no cross-reactivity, and ELISAs were more cross-reactive than RDTs. None of the RDTs or ELISAs displayed substantial differences for detection of recent versus remote PDI.

## Conclusions: 

All RDTs showed high specificity and low cross-reactivity, which minimizes the risk of vaccinating individuals not previously infected with dengue. RDTs varied in sensitivity and could be improved in this regard, which would minimize the number of individuals omitted from vaccination. Despite limitations, currently available dengue RDTs could be temporizing tools in endemic settings where dengue vaccination is being considered, assuming local assessment of performance.
