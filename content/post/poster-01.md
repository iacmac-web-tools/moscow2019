### Background:
Zika virus infection (ZIKV) epidemic became in 2016 a public health emergency of international concern in Latin America and the Caribbean (LA&C). We aimed to estimate the incidence of ZIKV among French travellers visiting LA&C during the summer of 2016.

### Materials/methods: 

Adult travellers to LA&C attending a visit from June to September 2016 at a French pre- travel clinic were invited to participate excluding past history of ZIKV or journey to LA&C since 2015. A screening was performed after return with both routine Euroimmun® ELISA (EI) IgM/IgG and in-house ELISA tests of the CNR with IgM antibody capture (MAC) and indirect IgG with the use of complete virus lysate (INDG) assays. A gold standard virus neutralization test (VNT) was retrospectively performed when positive or equivocal ELISA results or ZIKV-like symptoms.

### Results: 

Of the 324 eligible travellers, 75 were included. Of them, 42 (56%) were women, with a median age of 34 years [IQR 29 – 55]. Median length of stay was 20 days [IQR 15 – 33]. Destinations were South America 63 (84%), Central America 6 (8%) and Caribbean 6 (8%). Half (38) reported at least one health event including 7 (9%) fever and 12 (16%) others ZIKV-like symptoms (7 rashes, 5 pruritus). ELISA tests with EI IgM and MAC were all negative while EI IgG and INDG were positive for 4 and 1 travellers respectively. Four (5%) ZIKV cases were retrospectively confirmed by a subsequent positive VNT: one woman who presented fever in Guadeloupe [EI IgG positive; MAC negative and INDG positive] and three women with dermatological ZKV-like symptoms among whom 1 in Martinique [EI IgG negative and INDG negative] and 2 in Nicaragua with [EI IgG positive and INDG negative] and [initial EI IgG negative; late EI IgG equivocal and INDG negative]. The incidence rate was 5.9 ZIKV cases per 100 persons-months [IC95 1.9 – 14.3].

### Conclusions: 

This study is the first to report a suitable ZIKV incidence rate among travellers. The ZIKV cases with non-febrile symptoms would not have been confirmed without the pugnacity of physicians for obtaining a VNT. This emphasize the need for reliable routine ZIKV tests.
