## Background: 

Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected parasitic zoonosis prioritized by the WHO for control. Hygiene education is included in CE control campaigns; ingestion of contaminated food/water and contact with dogs are classically mentioned as infection sources, however, the precise risk factors for human infection are poorly understood. Several works investigated the potential risk factors through questionnaires, mostly carried out on small samples, providing contrasting results. We present the analysis of risk factors questionnaires administered to participants to the largest research-based prevalence study on CE conducted in Eastern Europe.

## Materials/methods: 

A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 24,687 people from rural Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey, who underwent abdominal ultrasound. Questions concerned demography, CE awareness, occurrence of cases in the family, dog and livestock-related practices, and food- and drinking water-related habits. “CE cases” were individuals with abdominal CE detected on ultrasound. Variables associated with CE infection at p<0.20 in bivariate analysis were included into a multivariable logistic model, with a random effect to account for clustering at village level. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95%CI were used to describe the strength of associations. Data were weighted to reflect the relative distribution of the rural population in the study area by country, age group and sex.

## Results: 

Valid records from 22,027 people were analyzed. According to the main occupation in the past 20 years, “housewife” (AOR 3.11 [1.51-6.41]) and “retired” (AOR 2.88 [1.09-7.65]) showed a significantly higher risk of being infected compared to non-agricultural workers. “Having relatives with CE” (AOR 4.18 [1.77-9.88]) was associated with higher odds of CE infection. Strikingly, dog-related and food/water-related factors were not associated with human infection.

## Conclusions: 

Our results point to infection being acquired in a “domestic” rural environment and support the view that CE should be considered more a “soil-transmitted” than a “food-borne” infection, acquired through a “hand-to-mouth” mechanism. This result helps delineating the dynamics of infection transmission and have practical implications in the design of community/habits-specific questionnaires and studies on parasite contamination of matrices, to shed light on actual sources of infection and at-risk behaviors and inform control campaigns.
